## Acceptance  Criteria
* Gathers all the specified criteria
* Uses techniques such as concatenation, casting and string methods.
* Python code runs

## Definition of Done
* Created a new repo
* Meets acceptance criteria
* Contains a README with a guide

## Setup
1. Create a new Repo.
2. Navigate to PyCharm and create a new project file with the same name as the Repo you have just created.
3. Create a .gitignore file and insert the following commands
